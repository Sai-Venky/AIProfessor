## Conclusion

This work is very close to our hearts as it opens up a new world of digital education which has the power to shape young minds of the future. Knowledge transfer of commendable quality can now take place between any two places of the world which are geographically distant. Better assimilation and dissemination of concepts is what we seek to achieve. Though there are limitations to our method (as discussed above), we believe that these can be overcome and remedied in the upcoming years.

We thank the OpenCV foundation for giving us this opportunity and the tools needed to innovate and bring our ideas to life. The Spatial AI Competition 2021, for us, has been a roller coaster ride with all its ups and downs amidst the pandemic. But in the end, we are happy that we made it! Now as the world gets back to normal, weâ€™re excited to put our product out in the world to enable Education in the best way we can.
