The act of knowledge sharing has taken up several forms throughout history with books being the major medium for several decades. Now, in this digital age, documents are shared electronically between groups of people. We seek to revolutionize this field yet again. With this goal in my mind, we give you:- AI Professor.

Let me take you back a few months to the inception of our idea. The pandemic engulfed the entire globe, all the easy and mundane tasks were now ported to the digital realm. This transition was hard and people were finding new ways to make things better. One challenge we noticed was in the domain of Education. All the classes were now online and teachers were struggling to disseminate knowledge to their students. They were so used to drawing and writing on the blackboard in class, that they found it hard to communicate the same concepts virtually in a verbal manner. Even with the assistance of visual tools such as PowerPoint presentations, there was this huge void between the lines of communication between users. This is where we saw an opportunity to bridge the gap. We planned to make a product that would enable instant transfer of knowledge using the power of Computer Vision. When we came across the OpenCV AI Competition, we realized that the OAK-D device would provide us with all the necessary tools to tackle the problem at hand.

Our product enables users to write simply with a wave of their fingers. With the help of gesture recognition and depth information obtained from the scene, we can also toggle between writing, erasing and tracking modes. To further augment the product, we have enabled choosing different colors using different gestures. This eliminates any special hardware that a teacher might need to buy to teach virtually. This form also seems more natural than writing on a writing-tablet. It also enables quick sharing of the notes that the teacher has written by a simple gesture.
